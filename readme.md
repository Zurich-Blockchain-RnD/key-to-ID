Private key management for people to improve on existing options.

Varying redundancy, recoverability, decentralization, UX, UI, etc capabilities can be balanced (with some creativness)
to create a private key recovery system that offers a better profile

If you ask for a perfect profile of one of these aspects you loose on others. If you ask for perfect decentralization you risk having lower redundancy


Assume storing unrecoverable, redundant database on a system like bittorrent 

Crucially, if we use multiple layers of security that all contribute to the security profile but are all still acceptable from a UX perspective, even if recovering
a private key isn't easy, neither is reassembling a lost wallet with all of tits credit cards, ID cards, etc. Maybe comparing it to a house keychain is better. If you
